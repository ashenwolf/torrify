The best choice of the tool\r\nhappened to be Tor and it was pretty good until I felt the need to have two\r\nexit-nodes (in US and in UK) running simultaneously, or at least making the\r\nswitch between those more comfortable and less time consuming.\r\n\r\n![Torrify screenshot](http://i.piccy.info/i7/dd525f70cdf2eb8a93495011859d1ac1/4-55-1735/42138161/torrify.png \"Torrify screenshot\")\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nInstall the application. Add several torrc files like the one below. Have fun.\r\n\r\n##### Torrc file samples:\r\n\r\n    # \r\n    # torrc-us: special torrent file for US exit nodes\r\n    #\r\n    SocksPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.\r\n    ControlPort 9051\r\n    ExitNodes {us}\r\n    ExcludeNodes {a1},{??}\r\n    StrictNodes 1\r\n    \r\n##### Todo\r\n\r\n* add simple torrc file editor\r\n* hash password support\r\n* add tor logging visualization\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHigh severity\r\n* None\r\n\r\nMedium severity\r\n* Occasionally the visualization of location and current ext. IP address i not up-to-date\r\n* Adding two or more torrc with the same file name may lead to unpredictable behavior\r\n* Adding two or more torrc with the same control port may lead to unpredictable behavior\r\n\r\nLow severity\r\n* The installer contains its own tor executable, so it may be not the recent version\r\n* No confirmation on deleting the torrc file from list (watch out)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor contributors\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe software is written purely using Qt5 + msvc2010. Ports to Linux would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n##### Useful links\r\n\r\n* Tor manual: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en\r\n* Torctl howto: https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torctl/trunk/doc/howto.txt","google":"UA-2554781-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
